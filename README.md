# infection process modelling
### Introduction
This repository will include various ways to model a viral infection, using different languages. This does not mean I plan to code every model in every language, help is welcomed for this task. For my particular needs and objectives I will prefer Julia, but order languages will be included.

### Objective
My general objective is to integrate chuncks of code that can be used to develop a epidemilogical model. Since this models can be very complex because of the many elements a epidemic includes (comorbilities, prevention measures, etc.), I plan to work on chuncks rather than a complete model, so I can integrate them as functions to study specific parts and evolutions of an epidemic.

### Code origin
I will recognise code authors, explicitly present licenses granted, and repositories.
